# CovidCare

This is a group project for BT3103 Application Systems Development for Business Analytics.

## Problem Statement

The trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic has been uncertain. The COVID-19 situation has persisted for over two years, with government protocols and measures changing from time to time according to the severity of the situation. Keeping up with these mandates might be confusing and troublesome for the general public. Additionally, the Ministry of Health (MOH) reported that hospitals' emergency departments have been flooded with patients, with 80% of them having mild symptoms that do not actually
require emergency care [(CNA, 2022)](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-hospital-emergency-department-gp-clinic-2482546).
